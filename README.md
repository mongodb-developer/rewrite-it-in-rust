# Rewrite it in Rust

*Rewrite it in Rust* is a short blog post series on the [MongoDB Developer Hub](https://developer.mongodb.com).

The [Python & Flask project](./flask-cocktail-api/) and the [Rust & Actix-Web project](./actix-cocktail-api) code was written to support the blog posts and aren't really designed to be viewed separately. There is also a small, low-quality selection of random cocktail recipes in a [MongoDB database export](./data).

I'll link to the blog posts here as they are published!
